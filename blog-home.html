    <h1>Welcome to Peter Sam's Blog</h1>
    <p>I was thinking about how to start off this blog for weeks. My indecisiveness has led me to postpone this blog for weeks even after I cashed in a $36 subscription
        for this internet domain name that has the most generic name for a blog. So, today, June 22nd 2019 at 9 pm, I decided to start my blog with a blog, 
        and just get on with it. Let me now go over what this website is all about.This website is the blog of Peter Sam who goes by the alias SourceBreaker. 
        This website will consist of blogs over topics such as technology, politics, the fantasy genre of literature, and more. 
        I will also post reviews on books and graphic novels that I have read. There will also be publications of my latest short stories or novels. Time to beginâ€¦</p>
