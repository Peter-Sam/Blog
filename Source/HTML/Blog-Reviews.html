  <h2>Review #1 - Saga Vol.1 By Brian K.vaughn and Fiona Staples</h2>

    I decided to pick up this graphic novel after looking for something new. I was kind of bored of the super hero
    universe of both Marvel and DC so I looked toward indie publishers for a fresh new story. After searching the
    internet for the highest rated indie graphic novels, Saga finally caught my eye. Everywhere on the internet I saw
    only praise for Saga. I saw a post online that claimed that Saga was like the combination of Star Wars and Game of
    Thrones. That got me excited. After reading the first volume, I can say that is not true. Saga is only like Star
    Wars in that it is set in outer space, and the only thing it strongly relates to Game of Thrones is the amount of
    mature content it has.

    Saga is a sci-fi fantasy epic with a simple overall premise. Two star-crossed lovers from opposing warring factions
    are trying to escape the war torn galaxy to a place that is more sustainable to raise a family. It’s a basic
    premise, but it offers a lot. The reader is introduced to the universe of Saga almost abruptly. There are so many
    planets, races, cultures, and technologies. So much is to be explored in this universe, and with this series
    predicted to only have 108 issues, I don’t think all the mysteries of Saga’s universe will be unveiled. The scale of
    world building is massive, but the narrative of the story almost ignores that to focus on the main characters: Marko
    the pacifist from the moon Wreath, Alana a military deserter from the planet Landfall, and their baby Hazel. In the
    midst of all the chaos and the foreign universe of Saga, Brian K. Vaughn wants to create a relatable human story
    which is a great thing. Even the way the characters speak is in a manner that sounds contemporary and relatable
    because of all the colloquialisms used in the dialogue.

    The first volume, focuses on the family escaping the planet Cleave. In order to escape, they must find the
    Rocketship forest. In the first few issues, we are introduced to the crazy world of Saga with talking robots with TV
    heads to giant sea turtles fighting space ships. The ideas presented in this book feel a bit over the top at some
    points. These are ideas that a kid could have came up with, but there is something about seeing this universe
    presented in a visual medium that makes it beautiful to look at much to the credit of the artist, Fiona Staples.

  <p>
    Fiona’s artwork is solid. The emotions look real, the coloring brings everything to life, and the paneling is
    handled
    with such great care so that some panels can speak volumes. Some of the artistic choices such as Prince IV, The TV
    head
    Robot, having flashbacks on his monitor was well thought out. The character designs are great – expect for Marko’s
    and
    especially the Stalker -, but I believe the creative team could have done a better job designing the setting of some
    of
    the places that are visited in the book. Each place did look different, but I just didn’t feel like there was any
    originality. Nothing about the landscape or the environment caught my eye. Some settings were a mix of modern day
    design
    and futuristic design.

    Moving on to the characters. The characters are great and probably the best part of the story, and with this amount
    of
    world building, I wouldn’t be surprised to see a hundred more characters before the end of this series. Marko and
    Alana
    act like new parents who are young and full of charisma. The Will is labeled as a villain, but he does have
    redeeming
    qualities as does Prince IV. These characters act out their role in the story but they act human. They have their
    own
    desires and ambition and life, and the reader is able to see both sides.

    One thing that bothered me about this book was the amount of mature content. It felt so unnecessary at certain
    points
    like the Sextillion plot line. It looks like the author wanted take as many creative liberties as he could to show
    how
    revolutionary his story is. The real reason is this is an Image comic book and creators can do much more at Image
    than
    the other two major comic book publishers.

  <figcaption>ummmm….ok? </figcaption>
  <p>The story was enjoyable, and it can definitely expand and go in many directions. I read through the first volume
    with ease, and thing that made it so easy to read was that it was a fun book. I already bought the second volume.
    That is the best rating I can give this book; I am going to continue reading this series till issue 108.</p>
