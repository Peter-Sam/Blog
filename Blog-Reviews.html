    I decided to pick up this graphic novel after looking for something new. I was kind of bored of the super hero universe of both Marvel and DC so I looked toward indie publishers for a fresh new story. After searching the internet for the highest rated indie graphic novels, Saga finally caught my eye. Everywhere on the internet I saw only praise for Saga. I saw a post online that claimed that Saga was like the combination of Star Wars and Game of Thrones. That got me excited. After reading the first volume, I can say that is not true. Saga is only like Star Wars in that it is set in outer space, and the only thing it strongly relates to Game of Thrones is the amount of mature content it has.

Saga is a sci-fi fantasy epic with a simple overall premise. Two star-crossed lovers from opposing warring factions are trying to escape the war torn galaxy to a place that is more sustainable to raise a family. It’s a basic premise, but it offers a lot. The reader is introduced to the universe of Saga almost abruptly. There are so many planets, races, cultures, and technologies. So much is to be explored in this universe, and with this series predicted to only have 108 issues, I don’t think all the mysteries of Saga’s universe will be unveiled. The scale of world building is massive, but the narrative of the story almost ignores that to focus on the main characters: Marko the pacifist from the moon Wreath, Alana a military deserter from the planet Landfall, and their baby Hazel. In the midst of all the chaos and the foreign universe of Saga, Brian K. Vaughn wants to create a relatable human story which is a great thing. Even the way the characters speak is in a manner that sounds contemporary and relatable because of all the colloquialisms used in the dialogue.

The first volume, focuses on the family escaping the planet Cleave. In order to escape, they must find the Rocketship forest. In the first few issues, we are introduced to the crazy world of Saga with talking robots with TV heads to giant sea turtles fighting space ships. The ideas presented in this book feel a bit over the top at some points. These are ideas that a kid could have came up with, but there is something about seeing this universe presented in a visual medium that makes it beautiful to look at much to the credit of the artist, Fiona Staples.
